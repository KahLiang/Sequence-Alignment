# Sequence-Alignment
A program with Sequence Alignment for my subject TIB2341 Introduction to Bioinformatics. 

Sequence Alignment or sequence comparison lies at heart of the bioinformatics, which describes the way of arrangement of DNA/RNA, or Protein sequences to identify the regions of similarity among them. It is used to infer structural, functional and evolutionary relationship between the sequences. Alignment finds similarity level between the query sequence and the different database sequences. The algorithm works by dynamic programming approach which divides the problem into smaller independent sub problems and finds the alignment more quantitatively by assigning scores.
